// Use .slice() to provide him with a list of these three things.
// Log this part of the list to the console. Unlike the two previous checkpoints, you should do both of these steps in one line.

// Log the grocery list to the console one more time.
// Notice that the groceryList array still contains the same items it had in Step 2.
