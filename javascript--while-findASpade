let cards = ['Diamond', 'Spade', 'Heart', 'Club'];

// create a variable named currentCard and set it equal to 'Spade'.
// This variable will hold the name of the card we just flipped. We are using 'Spade' as the first card.

let currentCard = 'Heart';

// Create a while loop. The condition should check if the currentCard is NOT a 'Spade'.
// Inside the while loop, log the value of currentCard to the console.
// Inside the while loop, below the console.log() statement you just wrote, add this code:
// currentCard = cards[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)];
// This code will generate a random number between 0 and 3, the range of indices of the cards array, and reassign currentCard to a new card from that array. Because the while loop only runs if the card is NOT a Spade, the value of currentCard will only be logged to the console if it is not 'Spade'.
// Outside the while loop, on the last line of the program, use console.log() to log that the program found a spade. You can use the string "found a spade" inside console.log().
// Change the currentCard that you set to 'Spade' in the first step to 'Heart' so that the program will run.
// Run the code a few times to see the output changing. You can see the while loop guessing a card, then seeing if it is a Spade, over and over, until it finds one.

while (currentCard != 'Spade') {
  console.log(currentCard);
  currentCard = cards[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)];
}
console.log('found a spade');
